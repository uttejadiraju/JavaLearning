/***
 * You might expect the program to print 26, as sets cannot contain duplicates.
 * If you try running the program, you’ll find that it prints not 26 but 260.
 * What is wrong with it? the author of the Bigram class intended to override
 * the equals method (Item 10) and even remembered to override hashCode in
 * tandem (Item 11). Unfortunately, our hapless programmer failed to override
 * equals, overloading it instead (Item 52). To override Object.equals, you must
 * define an equals method whose parameter is of type Object, but the parameter
 * of Bigram’s equals method is not of type Object, so Bigram inherits the
 * equals method from Object. This equals method tests for object identity, just
 * like the == operator. Each of the ten copies of each bigram is distinct from
 * the other nine, so they are deemed unequal by Object.equals, which explains
 * why the program prints 260. Luckily, the compiler can help you find this
 * error, but only if you help it by telling it that you intend to override
 * Object.equals. To do this, annotate Bigram.equals with @Override,
